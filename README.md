# MicroGPT Candle

A minimal GPT training and inference engine written using [Candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle), a minimalist ML framework for Rust. This is an alternative implementation of Andrej Karpathy's [microgpt](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/8627fe009c40f57531cb18360106ce95) that I wrote for learning reasons.

## Running

``` bash
cargo run
```

## Prerequisites

[Rust and Cargo](https://rustup.rs)
